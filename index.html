        Hello ai, it's been a while since we last talked with each other. Happy 21st Birthday to you my girl, you are so pretty and all. I know that I'm no longer
        the one that's holding you, i don't really know what to say now. If you ever see this or read this, just know that I will always love you. You are so perfect
        it's just sad that we aren't together anymore, I knew that i fucked up real bad. I'm regretting everything since that day, I should've listened to you more, 
        acted like a matured man that you know of. But hey, I hope that you are doing fine. Just know that I'm always rooting for you from afar, for your career, to your well-being
        and I'm missing you so bad. Happy birthday ulit, and I hope that you are enjoying your new life, be healthy as always, and take care of yourself. I'll be happy if you're 
        doing well by yourself. I know that you don't want anything to do with me anymore, but I'll always going to be here for you. Happy 21st Birthday ulit ai, enjoy your day and
        I hope that this message will reach you. I loved you and will always love you, take care. Good luck in your career, you were once my future architect. I'm rooting for you as always.
